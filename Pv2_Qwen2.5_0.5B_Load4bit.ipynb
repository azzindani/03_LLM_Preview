      "### Assistant: Corporate governance is a critical aspect of running a business, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has significantly influenced the industry's approach to ensuring fair and transparent reporting. The key provisions aimed at preventing accounting fraud include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accounting Standards Codification**: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that companies disclose their financial statements in a manner that aligns with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This ensures that financial statements are prepared in a manner that reflects the true value of the company's assets and liabilities, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Accounting Standards Updates**: Companies must periodically update their financial statements to reflect changes in accounting standards, such as those introduced by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This ensures that the financial statements remain aligned with the latest accounting standards, which are essential for maintaining transparency and accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Accounting Standards Enforcement**: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also mandates that companies must comply with the accounting standards that are in place, which can be challenging for companies that have not yet fully integrated into the accounting system. This can lead to significant compliance costs and potential reputational damage if a company fails to comply with the standards.\n",
