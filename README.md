# 🧠 LLM Preview in Google Colab

This repository offers quick previews of various **Large Language Models (LLMs)** running in Google Colab. Use this to explore how different models respond to prompts — no setup required.

## 🔍 What's Included

- 🚀 Preloaded notebooks for testing LLMs (transformers, instruction-tuned, chat-style, etc.)
- 🧪 Easy-to-edit prompt cells for quick experimentation
- ✅ Runs entirely in Colab – no local setup needed

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Google Colab (GPU runtime recommended)
- Hugging Face account (for models with gated access)

All required Python packages (like `transformers`, `accelerate`, etc.) will be auto-installed in each notebook.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Click a [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](#)
2. Run the notebook cell-by-cell.
3. Modify the prompt cell to try different inputs.
4. View the model's response instantly.

## 🔐 Note

Some models may require authentication with a Hugging Face token. Instructions are included in each notebook.
